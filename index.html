<h1><font face = "Courier New">Canadian Geese </h1>
<body><font face = "Courier New"> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_goose">Canadian geese</a> are like the <strong>rockstars</strong> of the bird world in Canada and parts of the northern U.S. You can spot them easily with their cool black heads, white cheeks, and brown bodies. They're famous for their loud honks and flying in that cool V-shape. These birds are real travelers, flying thousands of miles every year between their <strong>summer and winter hangouts.</strong> They're super social, sticking with their families and mates for life. But sometimes, they can get a bit too comfortable around people, causing a bit of trouble with their droppings and sometimes <strong>cranky</strong> attitudes. Still, they're a big part of the North American wildlife scene and add a lot of charm to any landscape.
